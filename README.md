A few tips to optimize and improve the performance in TYPO3 websites

### Caching Extbase Plugins
+ When configuring an extbase plugin, you can specify the allowed Controller actions as well as which actions should not be cached at all. (which will internally create a USER_INT object in TYPO3):

``` php
\TYPO3\CMS\Extbase\Utility\ExtensionUtility::configurePlugin(
   'Cyberhouse.Theme',
   'Pi2',
   [
       'Location' => 'list'
   ],
   // uncached actions:
   [
       'Location' => 'list'
   ]
);
```
+ I often stumble upon plugin configurations, that were initially set up as completely uncached for each action during development and never adapted after that. If your action doesnâ€™t involve server-side user interaction (or something similar), it is probably better off cached.
+ Sometimes it can be useful to deliver a completely cached web page and load uncached parts of the page via ajax. (The trade off would be more http requests in the frontend)
+ If your action needs to be uncached, but also contains computing-intensive parts, that can be cached, consider using the caching framework to cache and fetch these parts from a CacheBackend.
